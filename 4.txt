 install

*su / sudo / administratior privilages required*

  brew tap mongodb/brew              // 
  brew install mongodb-community@4.2 // MacOS
  
  apt install mongodb       // Debian
  apt-get install mongodb   // Ubuntu 
  emerge --ask mongodb      // Gentoo
  yum install mongodb-org   // RHEL
  

Task 2 - Start the mongo client tool by running “mongo” on the command line

 Before running the command-line inteface you should start a mongo daemon

 Possible service names on a different distros (mongodb|mongod|mongo)

 mongod  // Run a daemon manually

 Run as a service
 
*su / sudo / administratior privilages required*

    brew services start mongo                 // MacOS    
    systemctl start mongodb                   // SystemD  distros
    rc-service mongodb start                  // OpenRC   distros

Task 3 – Create a new database called bookStore and a new collection (called “books”) in the database

  use bookStore   // After the first collection save database will be created automatically
  
Task 4 - Perform and document (in a word document) the following actions on the collection created and document (in a word document) the commands you used.


// You can use .pretty() at the end of each query for more human-readable output


(1) Add at least 5 items from 2 categories to the collection; (Use google to find the same of some books that are in the categories you are going to use)
